Priority - Urgency + Importance both contribute to priority. Only mark one (1) box per category

- [ ] Urgent
- [ ] Not Urgent

- [ ] Important 
- [ ] Somewhat Important
- [ ]  Seems like a good idea

Goal(s) - what are we trying to achieve, whenever possible use action-oriented words. "To build", "To train", "To research". The Goal(s) should be for the Doer to be able to answer the question "What am I doing here?"

Is there a Deadline? If so, what is it?

Resources/People Needed 
Who is assigned to help?

Who do I go to for questions? 

Timeboxing - Time is also a resource. Therefore, this should not be used to provide a "deadline". Only to indicate duration. CAUTION: This should be filled in by the Team Lead, not the Doer. 

Start Date


Duration
- [ ] A Week
- [ ] Two Weeks
- [ ] Month 
- [ ] Several Months
- [ ] One Year
- [ ] More than A Year



Lead Time - Defined as the time NEEDED to perform the issue from Start to Finish. This should not be confused with Duration. Duration is the Time Given to perform the issue. It's important to assess with the Team Lead whether Duration and Lead Time are in-sync. This field may be filled in either by the Team Lead or the Doer. 

Scope - Often does not apply to small issues but critical for larger ones.
